### Project Name:Predict the Credit_Mix category for a customer based on their financial data, and provide actionable insights to improve credit health


### 1. Data Collection
- Gathered financial datasets containing customer details and credit information.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA using Jupyter Notebooks to understand data distributions, relationships, and missing values.
- Visualized key patterns and insights to guide feature selection.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Normalized and encoded categorical variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

### 4. Model Development
- Built and trained machine learning models using algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting
- Optimized hyperparameters using grid search.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

### 6. Actionable Insights
- Generated insights based on model predictions.
- Provided recommendations for improving customer credit health.
